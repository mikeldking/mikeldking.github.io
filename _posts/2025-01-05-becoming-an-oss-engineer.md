# From Skeptic to Advocate: How I Became an Open-Source Engineer

Two years ago, I faced a unique **choice**: the opportunity to work on open-source software while keeping my steady paycheck. As someone who had spent their entire career building closed-source products at privacy-focused companies, this proposition felt daunting and somewhat confusing. What did it even mean to "do" open-source at a company with successful closed-source products? The process seemed backwards – surely you start by figuring out what to build first then figure out whether or not to open-source it later?

I tentatively agreed to take on the challenge, but quickly realized that the person I had to convince the most was myself. This is the story of how I discovered that open-source development isn't just about giving away free software – it's about building a better businesses through transparency, trust, and community.

## The Journey

The hurdle to staring an OSS initiative wasn't technical – it was philosophical. Despite having a supportive CEO who championed the idea, building "free" software at a revenue-generating company required serious justification. OSS had to solve core business problems or it would quickly be dismissed as charity.

Through analysis, we identified four critical truths about our situation:

1. We needed **a lot more** more users touching our software to de-risk the business
2. Developer communities inherently distrusted vendors and prefer open-source tools
3. User trust hinges heavily on transparency
4. Data privacy concerns were blocking rapid adoption

### Getting Users

Not all businesses need a large user base, but relying on a small set of users and customers creates immense risk. I had experienced this firsthand at a previous company where market consolidation led to devastating customer churn. The value of a company can't solely rely on revenue – sometimes "We have X million users" is a more powerful statement than "We have X million in revenue."

To reach more users, you need something compelling that's easy to pick up and use. OSS fits this mold.

### Community Trust

In software communities, especially AI/ML ones, engineers almost always recommend open-source tools (PyTorch, HuggingFace, etc.) over vendor solutions. There's a simple reason: the first tools you learn tend to stick, and paid solutions must be dramatically better to justify the cost.

When building novel software, you have to take users on a journey with you. OSS enables this by making users active participants rather than passive consumers. Their feedback and investment directly translates into software they love. This is particularly crucial in the rapidly evolving GenAI space, where staying attuned to user needs is paramount.

### Transparency

Software development is rarely black and white, often muddied by politics and competing priorities. However, code itself is somewhat binary – it either works or it doesn't. Putting code in the can have a sterilizing effect - encouraging constructive feedback and demanding higher standards.

This proved true. Public scrutiny didn't just improve our code – it fundamentally changed how we approached development. Every decision had to be justified by end-user consumption, pushing us to build better software from the ground up and forcing us to figure out compounding pieces of software that held up to public scrutiny.

### Privacy

Enterprise sales cycles often get bogged down in security reviews and compliance discussions. OSS offers a unique advantage: companies can inspect the code themselves, run security audits, and most importantly, run everything within their own infrastructure.

This self-hosted capability transforms the conversation from "How do you handle our sensitive data?" to "Great, we can run this ourselves." The core technology can be validated by the community while still leaving room for enterprise features. This "try-before-you-buy" approach helps bypass traditional enterprise sales hurdles around data privacy and security.

## Conclusion

Looking back, my journey into open-source wasn't driven by a pure altruism. I sometimes tell non-technical friends that I write open-source software to "democratize AI tools" but the truth is more nuanced: open-source solved real business problems while aligning with deeper values about how software should be built and shared.

For companies entering new markets, especially in rapidly ones like AI, open-source isn't just an option – it's increasingly becoming a necessity. It's about [annealing the market](https://a16z.com/market-annealing-getting-to-10m-arr-in-very-early-markets/) while building something meaningful that stands the test of public scrutiny.

The choice I made two years ago wasn't just about changing how code – it was about fundamentally rethinking how a software company can succeed in an increasingly open world. By focusing on users, trust, transparency, and privacy, we discovered that open-source wasn't just a development methodology – it was a business catalyst that helped us build better products and establish the kind of trust that traditional approaches struggle to achieve.
